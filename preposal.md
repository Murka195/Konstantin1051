# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My plan is to create a weather report, which should read weather data every evening and then create a forecast for the next day. 
The idea is, that it first reads the data, thinks how to interpret this and export it as a text based report. 
The next step is that it creates a video which consists of prerecorded clips that gets cut together depending on the weather conditions. 
That means that I have to prerecord different video part for different conditions including numbers for the temperature and wind speed.
The goal is that I get a video of about 30sec every day, that will present the weather conditions for the next day. 
It should be in a phone format so about 1080by 1920 pixels.
