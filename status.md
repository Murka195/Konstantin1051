Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I found a cite where I can download a forecast for the next day. My program reads the file and depending on the conditions it produces a text, summarizing the general conditions (doesn't work properly yet), the temperatures in fahrenheit and celcius, the windspeed in kmh and mph, and the winddirection in degrees and drections.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to make the general decition, on how the weather will be more accurate. And work on the video export of the report. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Nothing yet.
