Konstantin Kluge - Spring 2023 - 1051 - Rosen

I coded a program that reads through an API weather data and creates a text and video based weather report. The idea behind this project was, that I used the base of what we learned in the class, because I had no experience with coding before. So, I used file reading to start my project. Once I had a decently good weather report, I continued adding stuff to it, that I did not learn in class. For example, the API. This made it for me possible to easily access different days and locations to use my code even better. In the end, I wanted to add at least some kind of video report. So, I figured that the Movie.Py library works for that well. I prerecorded some video to try it out and it works. But because my general report itself is on a very base level, it is not fun watching the video. Also, the video just works for the general conditions and not for the temperatures and wind speeds. I wanted to make the project as simple as possible, but still use everything I learned and what I wanted to achieve. And I reached that point. A file reading and a text export. 

I had some challenging with the way how I read the data. I downloaded CSV weather data, but it always seemed impossible to use it to read something in an easy way. So I decided to just read the "icons" values (the ones that summarize an hour of weather and present a picture of that on the phone). And that worked well for me. 
Also, because I don't know how to structure a giant project, it came a little bit out of control in terms of organizing my code. I think in the future, i will inform myself first how to start such a big project before starting coding. 

In the end, I really liked the project and I might even fine tune my report in the future.
